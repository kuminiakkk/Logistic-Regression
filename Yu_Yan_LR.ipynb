    "In the relationship between the step and loss figure, we can see that with the increase of the L2 penalty, the decrease of loss becomes slow. That is because the L2 penalty is designed for combating overfitting by forcing weights to be small; therefore, it will make the change slightly and might avoid the overfitting problem. However, when we set the L2 penalty to 0.1, it will cause over-regularization which makes the decrease of loss very slow. Therefore, improving L2 will cause a decrease in convergence speed."

    "As the figures show, we can see the increase in learning rate will also increase the speed of loss decrease and cause a quick convergence speed. And for the f1 score, we can see the increase in learning rate will promote the speed of the f1 score increase. When the learning rate is 0.005, the f1 score even retains 0, which means we should increase the learning rate to make the model converge quickly; when the learning rate is too big, the training model might converge too quickly and even miss the optimal solution and reach to the suboptimal point, which is also inadvisable."

    "In summary, I use two different methods to predict the f1 score for the test dataset in kaggle. First, I design the Logistic Regression Algorism by NumPy library and reach the f1 score of 0.25668. Second, I implement the PyTorch library and get the f1 score of 0.29946, which is higher than the score I get using the NumPy library. Therefore, using the PyTorch library will result in a better model for me."
